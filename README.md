<h2> Project: Routing Protocols via Sockets </h2>

This project provides an understanding of routing protocols via sockets. It teaches how to implement a simple Distance Vector Protocol, and it simulates a router using software defined routing. <br>

***Objectives***
1. To understand Routing protocols via sockets
2. To gain exposure to a practical implementation of Distance Vector Protocol
3. To simulate a router using software defined routing
